Killua, haven't you...?Been on a date?No way!My whole life was spenttraining to be an assassin,and since I met you,we've beentogether all the time, right?I see.The truth is,from now on, too,always...
It's not just that...That aura of Maor...!!Certainly, his aura nodes are open, and he's entered the final stagebefore using Nen abilities... Considering his condition this morning,it's an incredible jump up.This person, Kurapika... it seems he's truly aiming for the diffusion and equilibrium of military power.Meaning,whether a beginner or not,depending on the nature of their ability,a Nen ability can becomea threat to even advanced users!!Furthermore, the clear objectiveof guarding a prince distinctlyinfluences the characteristicsof Nen abilities...!!Abilities to know an enemy's ability,abilities to nullify an enemy's ability,abilities to steal an enemy's ability, etc.Like me, it's certain that many abilitiesof the type that counter an opponent's Nen abilitywill manifest!The longer we stand idly by,the higher the risk becomes...!If we're going to move, the sooner the better.I'd love to use my Strangerto strike down Kurapika, who's the source of the trouble,but to do that, I need to graspsall five of his abilities,which are only assumed to exist.That's not a realistic condition.Because Strangeris automatic,it has bad compatibility with enemies who possess multiple abilities,and especially no way to evade intercept-type abilities...!If the opponentis an Enhancer or Emitter,the ability user's main bodybecomes the target,but being counteredis also common.It's by no means invincible;rather, it falls into the category of a wild shot.The reason it's a wild shotdespite requiringa 48-hour recharge period after useis none other than because if it hits, it's a sure kill.In that case, perhaps I should target the 9th Princeinstead of the 5th... / Even with the danger, because the 9th Princeis moving, there's room to utilize my abilityin the Private Chamber...To learn the enemy's ability from a statewhere information is as close to zero as possible...!I must do it myself, or else Strangerwon't grow strong.If I secure safety by using other soldiers, conversely,the Strangerthat is born will weaken, and the dangerthat it won't be able to devour the enemy will increase... /Judging this danger and opportunitydepends greatly on each person's experience...! Because it's a life-or-death decision,everyone has confidence in their intuition.I understand that the Captain of the Guard issued instructionsfor restraint, considering the overall situation based on his many years of experience...But hasn't he become too cautious due to Shikaku's suicide...?Isn't it progress that we've obtained informationthat there's a Manipulator-type ability user among the close aides,or that the Prince's Nen beast is a Manipulator-type?j
Alright!
Let's go!!!!

I
will
become the Pirate King!!!

And so,
the great journey
began!!!!

In each volume, we meet
them and our companions,
sailing the sea.
All right!
Let's go!!!!

I will
become
King of the Pirates!!!

And so,
the great journey
began!!!!

Again, different
companions
are dragged into
the ship,
sailing the sea.
Here we go!!!!

I will

the Pirate King!!!

And so,
the great journey
began!!!!

Each volume, they
travel the sea
with their friends.
Alright!
Let's go!!!!

I'm going to be

King of the Pirates!!!

Every volume, he...
Ahead of that...
Included in the friendship... (Difficult to translate this part directly, it's fragmented and poetic)
The ship... amongst... (Again, fragmented and poetic)
The friends
Go to the sea

And so,
The great journey
Began!!!!
Alright!
Let's go!!!!

I'm going to be

King of the Pirates!!!

As always, there's no
short story involving
the middle layer
of the ship.
Sailing the sea.

And so,
the great journey
began!!!!
All right!
Let's go!!!!

I will become

the Pirate King!!!

As always,
the ship sails on,
as if to drown out
the clamor within.

And so,
the great journey
has begun!!!!

Translated <LINK> to English

[1]
That's not all...



[2]
Maor's aura...!!



[3]
Indeed, his aura nodes have opened, and he's entered the final stage before being able to use Nen abilities... Considering his condition this morning, it's an amazing jump up.



[4]
This Kurapika... it seems he's truly aiming to spread and balance military power.



[5]
Even a beginner can become a threat to an expert, depending on the nature of their ability!! That's Nen ability!



[6]
Furthermore, the clear objective of guarding a prince has a marked influence on the characteristics of Nen abilities...!!



[7]
Abilities to know an enemy's ability, abilities to negate an enemy's ability, abilities to steal an enemy's ability, etc... Just like me, it's inevitable that many abilities that counter the opponent's Nen ability will manifest!



[8]
The more we stand idly by, the higher the risk becomes...! If we're going to move, the sooner the better.



[9]
I'd love to crush Kurapika, the source of all this, with my "Stranger," but...



[10]
To do that, I need to grasp all five of his abilities, which are presumed to exist.



[11]
That's not a realistic condition. Because "Stranger" is automatic, it has poor compatibility with enemies possessing multiple abilities, and especially has no way to evade intercept-type abilities...!



[12]
The reason why it's a "wild shot" despite needing a 48-hour recharge period after use is none other than because if it hits, it's a sure kill.



[13]
In that case, perhaps I should target the Ninth Prince instead of the Fifth... Even though there's danger, the fact that the Ninth Prince is moving means there's room to utilize my ability in the Private Room...



[14]
To learn the enemy's abilities from a state where information is as close to zero as possible...! I myself must do that, or "Stranger" won't grow strong.
You got it?

[2]
You shouldn't press that

[3]
if you don't need anything, okay?
